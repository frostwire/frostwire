/**
 * TaskThrottle provides thread-safe task throttling functionality to prevent tasks from being
 * executed too frequently. It maintains a lock-free map of task names to their last submission
 * timestamps and ensures minimum intervals between task executions.
 * 
 * <p>This implementation uses {@link ConcurrentHashMap} for lock-free concurrent access,
 * eliminating the global monitor bottleneck present in synchronized collections like {@link java.util.Hashtable}.
 * 
 * <p><b>Thread Safety:</b> All methods are thread-safe and can be called from multiple threads
 * concurrently without external synchronization.
 * 
 * <p><b>Memory Management:</b> The class automatically recycles old task entries that haven't
 * been accessed for {@link #TASK_RECYCLE_INTERVAL_IN_MS} to prevent unbounded memory growth.
 * 
 * <h3>Usage Example:</h3>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Throttle a search operation to run at most once per second
 * if (TaskThrottle.isReadyToSubmitTask("search-operation", 1000)) {
 *     // Execute the search
 *     performSearch();
 * }
 * 
 * // Check when a task was last submitted
 * long lastSubmission = TaskThrottle.getLastSubmissionTimestamp("search-operation");
 * if (lastSubmission != -1) {
 *     System.out.println("Last run: " + (System.currentTimeMillis() - lastSubmission) + "ms ago");
 * }
 * }</pre>
