/**
 * A Context wrapper that prevents registration of CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE broadcast receivers.
 *
 * DEPRECATED: This class was created as a workaround for Picasso 3.0.0-alpha06's 
 * HandlerDispatcher race condition. Since the app has migrated to Coil for image loading,
 * this workaround is no longer needed and this class can be safely removed in future cleanup.
 *
 * Original purpose: Picasso's NetworkBroadcastReceiver could receive broadcasts after the 
 * Handler had been nulled out, causing NullPointerException in HandlerDispatcher.dispatchNetworkStateChange().
 * By preventing the registration of network connectivity receivers, we avoided the crash
 * while still allowing Picasso to function normally for image loading.
 *
 * NOTE: CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE broadcast was deprecated in API 24 and restricted in API 26+.
 * Modern apps should use ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback instead (see NetworkManager).
 * Coil doesn't have these issues as it uses modern Android networking APIs.
