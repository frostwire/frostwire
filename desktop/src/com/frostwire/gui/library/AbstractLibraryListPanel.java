/**
 * The left hand side JPanels that contain JLists when used

 * Since it takes some time to refresh the contents of the table,
 * we cannot order these tables to scroll down to a certain position
 * until all the data has been loaded.

 * This Abstract class has been created to enqueue Runnable tasks
 * that should be performed once the right hand side mediators
 * have finished loading.

 * Use enqueueRunnable on your implementations of the {@link AbstractLibraryListPanel}
