/**
 * Draws a cell with it's default renderer, but the foreground
 * colored differently.
 * <p>
 * Due to the nature of renderer components being shared
 * between cells, this can not act directly on the renderer
 * that's returned.  Otherwise, this has the side effect of altering
 * future renderings that aren't necesarily from a ColoredCell.
 * To still allow complete functionality of the
 * ColorRenderer to work regardless of the cell's specific renderer,
 * this will instantiate a copy of that renderer and cache it for future
 * use.
 * <p>
 * ******************************************************************
 * This requires that any cell that is being colored have a default
 * TableCellRenderer that has a parameterless constructor.
 * ******************************************************************
 * <p>
 * New renderers are created flyweight-style.
 * <p>
 * All useful calls are wrapped and redirected to the underlying renderer.
 * <p>
 * This class takes advantage of the potential of the 'renderer' component
 * to not be the TableCellRenderer itself.  It is merely by convention
 * that all getTableCellRendererComponent calls return 'this'.
 * However, there is nothing that specifically states the TableCellRenderer
 * does not delegate to other renderers.  Unfortunately, the JTable
 * sends UI updates to the TableCellRenderer, and not the component that
 * does the renderering.  TableCellRenderer is actually a rather poor name,
 * or more precisely, the function 'getTableCellRendererComponent' is a
 * poor name for being in an interface titled TableCellRenderer.
 * The delegate functionality is useful, but so is the rubber-stamping.
 * It would probably have been better to name getTableCel.. 'stamp'.
 * <p>
 * This class does *NOT* instantiate new copies of the component returned
 * from getTableCellRendererComponent.  It needs new copies of the
 * TableCellRenderer, in order to call further getTableCellRendererComponents.
 * Since the two are generally the same, it works out nicely.
 * <p>
 * UI Updates are propagated to all contained TableCellRenderers.
 * <p>
 * For clarity, this class just extends JComponent (needed to recieve
 * an updateUI call).  It is not really a component -- it just delegates.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: This does not color selected or focused cells.
